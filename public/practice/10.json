      "passage": "Although students are busy studying, it's important to remember another area of study — life skills, such as washing clothes and growing vegetables. They're useful in our daily lives. Here are some opinions about life skills education.\n\n**Mrs. Blair:** Children need to learn most of the life skills at school. As parents, we can help them take part in activities around the house and in the <u>neighbourhood</u>.\n\n**Li Ping:** We have life skills classes at school. They're quite useful. They help prepare for everyday real-life situations, from washing dishes to preparing a meal. These classes give us knowledge we need to live on our own.\n\n**Mary:** Having life skills classes at school is important. Besides, there are other ways for us to learn life skills. We can watch videos on the Internet. We can also learn from our parents and take part in the activities with them.\n\n**Kevin:** I'm not sure whether it's necessary because I haven't tried life skills classes yet. In my school, many students pay no attention to learning life skills. They don't think it'll improve their chances of getting into college.",
