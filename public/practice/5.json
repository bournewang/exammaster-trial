      "passage": "I can still remember the first day when I met my best friend. She had just moved to the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother, scared of looking at each other.\n\nSoon, we lost the shyness and started playing with each other, riding bikes to each other's house and having sleepovers. In 7th grade she was going through family problems. However, every summer we would sit at each other's house, watch movies on TV and talk about all the boys we liked.\n\nIt was last year that I noticed the problem. She suffered from clinical depression (临床抑郁症), and had to go to a hospital during the day. I was very sorry for her at first. But with the late night calls and meeting each other halfway up the street at midnight, we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there for her since her new best friend left her, and I knew I still cared about her like a sister.\n\nYesterday she came to me and said, \"I never knew what a best friend was until you were the only person that would stop me from cutting myself and that ever made me feel better about myself and my problems. You didn't know this but I was trying to kill myself that very night you called me and I was crying. I owe you so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\"\n\nWe both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is to never give up your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you leave them, you will only be very sorry. So if your friends need you, and you care about them, you should be always there for them.",
